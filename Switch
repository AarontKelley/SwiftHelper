The switch operator is great for checking multiple conditions.
EXAMPLE:
let weather = "sunny"
switch weather {
case rain:
  print("Bring an umbrella")
case snow:
  print("Better put some layers on today")
 case sunny:
  print("Bring sunscreen it's going to be a scorcher")
 default:      --important to have if no conditions are met
   print("Enjoy your day")
   
   This will print Bring sunscreen it's going to be a scorcher
